		<div id ="miss_statement">
			<p><span>We think parents, students, schools and teachers pay way too much money for what's out there.</span> Almost all graphing calculators currently on the market have seen little technological innovation since their debut in 1990. Current standardized tests only allow use of graphing calculators that are too expensive for students for low-income backgrounds to access. We want to change this.<p>

						<li> <span>08/5/13</span> We are in round three of drafting the Pitch Deck; we've been doing weekly run-throughs and iterating revisions.</li>
						<li> <span>07/25/13</span> We have formed a value proposition and have begun drafting a pitch deck: we used the Sequoia Capital outline at www.sequoiacap.com/ideas to create a value proposition for the Hackulator project.</li>
						<li> <span>07/24/13</span> We have finished consolidating our preliminary research on the way students and teachers interact with graphing calculators and are now drafting a teacher survey based off of these findings.</li>

					<h1>Plans</h1>

					<ul>
						<li> User Based Testing with Teachers: We have an existing survey for questions to ask teachers. If you are a teacher or have teacher friends who would be interested in participating in the survey, please send us an email at hackulator.info[at]gmail.com.</li>
						<li>Oliver and Anisha will be sitting down with their Python programming mentor to discuss the trajectory for coding the the graphing calculator software.</li>

				<div id="problems" class="ppp_item col span_1_of_3">
					<h1>Problems</h1>


					<ul>
						<li> We are looking for more detailed statistics on how many students in the United States cannot afford to buy current graphing calculator models like the TI-83. Any information on this would be much appreciated.</li>
						<li> It is still up to much debate whether the Arduino hardware will be used for the calculator. It is unsure whether using this hardware will likely cause the Hackulator to be banned on most standardized tests.</li>
