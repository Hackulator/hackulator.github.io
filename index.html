<p><em><strong>We think parents, students, schools and teachers pay way too much money for current graphing calculator models.</strong></em> Almost all graphing calculators currently on the market have seen little technological innovation since their debut in 1990. Current standardized tests only allow use of graphing calculators which are too expensive for low-SES students to access. We want to change this. </p>

<p><strong>Avi Karnani:</strong>
Developed a lifelong love of learning and math when in montessori school his teacher thought it better to let him play with a calculator instead of naptime. Later he saw that students in under resourced schools didnt have access to graphing calculators; they were locked up and only available for short segments of classroom time.  Cost was cited as the reason why.</p>

<p><strong>Anisha Ramnani:</strong>
Anisha thinks math is awesome and wants to make sure this calculator helps people be less scared of math. She feels too many students are overwhelmed by the fact that math builds on previously learned material over the years and doesn't want it to be that way.</p>

<p><strong>Oliver Switzer:</strong> 
A lifelong tinkerer who in college decided Physics is where its at. Heâ€™s spent more time working with graphing calculators than a healthy person should; like a loving partner he understands their flaws and wants to help them be better.</p>
