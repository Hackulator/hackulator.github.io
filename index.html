<p><em><strong>We think parents, students, schools and teachers pay way too much money for what's out there.</strong></em> Almost all graphing calculators currently on the market have seen little technological innovation since their debut in 1990. Current standardized tests only allow use of graphing calculators that are too expensive for students for low-income backgrounds to access. We want to change this. </p>

<p>Having many connections to local hacker spaces throughout New York City, one of the main goals of this project is to seek out feedback from those who have already begun confronting the issues and limitations of current calculator models.  </p>

<p>The Hackulator is a work in progress. We will be posting our "PPP: Progress, Plans, Problems" here, so you can see what we've been up to and what we need! If you think you can help and would like to be a part of the process, we'd love to hear from you. Send your advice, concerns, or just friendly hello's to <a href="mailto:hackulator.info@gmail.com">hackulator.info@gmail.com</a>!</p>

<p><em><strong>Progress</strong></em></p>

<p><em>08/5/13 Have started to code an online prototype for the calculator</em> using Python for back-end and HTML/Java for front-end.</p>

<p><em>08/5/13 In round two of drafting the Pitch Deck:</em> doing weekly run-throughs and iterating revisions.</p>

<p><em>07/25/13 Formed Value Proposition and Have Begun Drafting a Pitch Deck:</em> We used the Sequoia Capital outline at <a href="http://www.sequoiacap.com/ideas">www.sequoiacap.com/ideas</a> to create a value proposition for the Hackulator project. </p>

<p><em>07/24/13 Finished Research:</em> We have finished blocking our existing research and are now ready to do user based testing. </p>

<p><em><strong>Plans</strong></em></p>

<p>User Based Testing with Teachers: We have an existing survey for questions to ask teachers. If you are a teacher or have teacher friends who would be interested in participating in the survey, please send us an email at hackulator.info@gmail.com. </p>

<p>Plan to Code Calculator: Oliver and Anisha will be sitting down with their Python programming mentor to discuss the trajectory for coding the the graphing calculator software.  </p>

<p><em><strong>Problems</strong></em></p>

<p>Market Size: We are looking for more detailed statistics on how many students in the United States cannot afford the costs of graphing calculators like the TI-83. Any information on this would be much appreciated. </p>

<p>Hardware: We are still debating whether Arduino hardware will be used for the calculator. It is unsure whether using this hardware will likely cause the Hackulator to be banned on most standardized tests.</p>

<p><strong>Avi Karnani:</strong>
Developed a lifelong love of learning and math when in montessori school his teacher thought it better to let him play with a calculator instead of naptime. Later he saw that students in under resourced schools didnt have access to graphing calculators; they were locked up and only available for short segments of classroom time.  Cost was cited as the reason why.</p>

<p><strong>Anisha Ramnani:</strong>
Anisha thinks math is awesome and wants to make sure this calculator helps people be less scared of math. She feels too many students are overwhelmed by the fact that math builds on previously learned material over the years and doesn't want it to be that way.</p>

<p><strong>Oliver Switzer:</strong> 
A lifelong tinkerer who in college decided Physics is where it’s at. He’s spent more time working with graphing calculators than a healthy person should; like a loving partner he understands their flaws and wants to help them be better.</p>
